Description: Imports .cov files and .bed files from WES/ WGS CNV (copy number variation) detection pipelines and utilises several metrics to weigh the likelihood of a sample containing a detected CNV being a true CNV or a false positive. Highly useful for diagnostic testing to filter out false positives to provide clinicians with fewer variants to interpret. SARC uniquely only used COV and BED files which are the most common CNV pipeline calling filetypes, and can be used as an alternative to the Interactive Genome Browser (IGV), which can be especially helpful in large cohorts with 100s-1000s of patients.
